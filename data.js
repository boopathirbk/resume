        title: "My Journey",
        content: `The story starts in 2015 when I joined Computer Science Engineering. Fascinated by the open-source world, I dove deep into Linux and WordPress. During college, I explored everything from React Native to design tools, even building an NFC-based lost baggage retrieval system. 
        
        Although I was selected as a Linux Administrator in 2019, I chose to explore freelancing to build fast, AAA-standard, and SEO-friendly websites. I believe in a step-by-step approach to create stable, clean systems.
        
        My career path took me through roles as a Web Developer and IT Support Executive, where I honed my skills in MS 365, Azure, and system troubleshooting. I've worked day and night shifts, supported global clients, and now leverage AI and prompt engineering to create open-source innovations.`
